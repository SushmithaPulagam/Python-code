Deep Learning Tutorial
---------------------------

What is AI - capability of a machine to iitate intelligent human behaviour

Applications of AI - Speech Recognition, NLP, Image recognization

What is ML - Subset of AI.Make the computers learn.
Limitations of ML - cannot deal with huge data. cannot deal with feature extractions.

Deep learning is implemented through Neural Networks.
DL skips the manual steps of extracting features, we can directly feed the images to the DL algorithm which then predicts the object.

Keras
_________

Keras is a wrapper and it can work on top of Tensorflow or Theano or CNTK.
CNTK - Microsoft Deeplearning tool kit
Tensorflow - Google made it. In Tensorflow, we need to start a sessions and write some code. But in Keras, the code lines will get reduced.

Drawback of keras : The model built in keras may not be available to deploy in all the platforms. So ,we might end up doing the model from scratch in Tensorflow for deployment. 

It is recommeneded that to do POC's in keras and once it is successful, build the same with Tensorflow for deployment.

Keras  supports both convolutinal networks and recurrent networks , as well as combination oftwo.
Run seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
